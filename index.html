        <div id="about-text"><h1>About Plett Paws</h1>
        <p>We are a small dog shelter in Plettenberg Bay, run and maintained by a great community of donors, volunteers and fosterers. We were founded by Sandy and her sister Esme in 2006, starting when they'd bring in stray dogs to foster in their family home. Since then, we've grown hugely! We've since homed nearly 100 dogs and we now have our own shelter near Robberg Road. We have a great community and are always looking for people to join us. We need volunteers to help us walk the dogs, provide foster homes, help out at the shelter, and join us on trap neuter and release outings. We're also reliant on donations frmo the public, so if you're able to provide a once-off or recurring support please let us know and we'll send over our bank details!</p>
