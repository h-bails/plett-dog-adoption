# Plett Paws

Plett Paws is a dog rescue in Plettenberg Bay, South Africa. This website provides a home for Plett Paws Dog Shelter on the internet. It seeks to help users achieve one of two goals: 1) Adopt a dog, or 2) Submit their details in order to support the shelter (whether that’s through volunteering or donation).  It’s intended to be fuss-free and easy to maintain.
